### TTK ###
TTK (Tiny Tool Kit (as in GTK)) aims to be a extremely light weight GUI toolkit for embedded systems and devices like the arduino. TTK handles all the rendering and only requires that the user write a layer for TTK to talk to the screen. TTK is written in c++ and aims to be system and architecture agnostic.

TTK contains a virtualizer (GTK) for debugging and creating and debugging interfaces on a desktop computer.
