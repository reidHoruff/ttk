### TTK ###
TTK (Tiny Tool Kit (as in GTK)) aims to be a extremely light weight GUI toolkit for embedded systems and devices like the arduino. TTK handles all the rendering and only requires that the user write a layer for TTK to talk to the screen. TTK is written in c++ and aims to be system and architecture agnostic.

TTK also aims to maintain an extremely small footprint and allows user the option to not compile in any widgets they do not intend to use. Conversly, it is also extremely to create new widgets that fully integrate into TTK.

TTK contains a virtualizer (GTK) for debugging and creating and debugging interfaces on a desktop computer.
